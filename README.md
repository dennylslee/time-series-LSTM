# Introduction

This project uses the popular Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network for performing simple time series forcasting (prediction).  Sensitivity to training set size is analyzed.

Two main programs are contained in this project:
1. cosine-datagen.py for generating the time series for analysis
2. cosine-RNN-LSTM.py for constructing the LSTM 

The LSTM is built on Keras framework.
